        "\n",
        "Description:\n",
        "This script is designed to scrape personnel profiles, such as faculty or staff members, from a paginated website.\n",
        "The script first collects all profile links from all pages, ensuring comprehensive data collection.\n",
        "It then scrapes each profile using multi-threading, significantly reducing the scraping time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Features:\n",
        "1. Collects all profile links across multiple pages to avoid missing any data due to pagination issues.\n",
        "2. Scrapes detailed profile information, including name, description, employment status, and email.\n",
        "3. Utilizes multi-threading to scrape multiple profiles concurrently, improving efficiency.\n",
        "4. Handles dynamic page navigation using JavaScript execution.\n",
        "5. Includes error handling for robustness and reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modules Used:\n",
        "- Selenium: For browser automation and interaction with web elements.\n",
        "- concurrent.futures: For implementing multi-threading.\n",
        "- time: For adding delays to mimic human behavior and ensure proper page loading.\n",

        "This script is designed to scrape profiles of personnel (e.g., faculty or staff) from a paginated website.\n",
        "It uses multi-threading to scrape multiple profiles concurrently, significantly reducing the total execution time.\n",
        "The script extracts details such as names, descriptions, employment status, and emails for analysis or record-keeping.\n",

        "Features:\n",
        "1. Scrapes profile data from all pages dynamically.\n",
        "2. Utilizes multi-threading to handle concurrent scraping tasks efficiently.\n",
        "3. Extracts detailed information, including URLs, names, descriptions, and contact details.\n",
        "4. Includes robust error handling for thread safety and resilience.\n",
        "5. Designed to maximize resource utilization and minimize scraping time for large datasets.\n",
